### Candidate assignment for Clarity

##### Guidelines

Welcome, we are happy to be at a stage were both sides want to collabarate together. The goal of this assignmet is to evaluate development skills.

Take your time, there is no hard limit timewise.
It is ok to make assupmtions. If the requirement is unclear, make assumptions based on your experience & knowledge. Document your assumptions so we can reference them later.
It is ok not to complete everything, but implement your code with a state of mind that it goes to production.
Be ready to explain live implmementation or what is still missing to make it production ready.
